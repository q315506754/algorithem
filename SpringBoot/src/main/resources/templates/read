Spring Boot includes auto-configuration support for the following templating engines:

FreeMarker
Groovy
Thymeleaf
Mustache


JSPs should be avoided if possible, there are several known limitations when using them with embedded servlet containers.


When youâ€™re using one of these templating engines with the default configuration, your templates will be picked up automatically from src/main/resources/templates.
